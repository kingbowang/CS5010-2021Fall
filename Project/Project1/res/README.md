# Project 1 - Primates

### 1. About/Overview

The task is to develop a system that provides a permanent home and high-quality sanctuary care for New World primates who have been castoff from the pet trade, retired from institute, or confiscated by authorities. In this system, They could save information with data records and keep track of the individual animals that are in their care. 
In this project, I save all monkeys information and house information and could track isolation and enclosures.

### 2. List of Features

* save monkeys information
* set attention for a monkey with proper information
* add new monkeys to Isolation
* expand isolation
* remove monkeys from Isolation to Enclosure
* expand Enclosures
* keep track all monkeys and all species

### 3. How To Run

Instructions to run the program should include the following:
Just run the jar file or run the driver class with no argument.

### 4. How to Use the Program

Sanctuary class is a primary class to use. We could use Sanctuary class to track Isolation class and Enclosure class. Thus, the two classes could track all monkeys information.

### 5. Description of Examples

Run1:
1. create a new monkey
2. add the monkey to Isolation
3. set attention for this monkey
4. move this monkey to Enclosure

Run2:
1. create a new monkey1
2. create a new monkey2
3. set attention for monkey1 and monkey2
4. move monkey1 and monkey2 to Enclosure
5. get all species information

### 6. Design/Model Changes
None.

### 7. Assumptions
I assume that only monkeys will be saved, and only the given food type is used.
Besides, I assume that monkeys must be set attention before move to enclosure, new monkeys must be sent to isolation.
